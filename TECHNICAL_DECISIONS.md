# Technical Decisions and Implementation Notes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### 1. State Management: Provider vs Bloc

**Decision**: Used Provider for state management

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Provider has less boilerplate code compared to Bloc
- **Learning Curve**: Easier for developers new to Flutter state management
- **Project Scope**: For this grocery app's complexity, Provider is sufficient
- **Performance**: Provider's ChangeNotifier is adequate for the app's state needs
- **Community**: Well-established pattern with extensive documentation

**Alternative Considered**: Bloc/Cubit
- Would be better for larger, more complex applications
- Provides better separation of business logic
- More testable architecture
- Steeper learning curve

### 2. Data Persistence: SharedPreferences vs SQLite

**Decision**: Used SharedPreferences for cart persistence

**Rationale**:
- **Use Case**: Cart data is simple key-value storage
- **Performance**: Fast read/write operations for small data sets
- **Simplicity**: No need for complex database schema
- **Cross-platform**: Works consistently across all Flutter platforms
- **Size**: Cart data is typically small and doesn't require relational queries

**Alternative Considered**: SQLite (sqflite)
- Would be better for complex data relationships
- Better for large datasets
- Provides ACID transactions
- Overkill for simple cart storage

### 3. Project Structure: Feature-based vs Layer-based

**Decision**: Used feature-based structure with clear separation

**Structure**:
```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/           # Data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/         # Business logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/        # State management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/          # UI components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.dart
```

**Rationale**:
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without restructuring
- **Maintainability**: Related code is grouped together
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between UI, business logic, and data
- **Team Development**: Multiple developers can work on different features

### 4. Image Handling: Network Images vs Local Assets

**Decision**: Used network images from Unsplash

**Rationale**:
- **Realism**: Demonstrates real-world app behavior with network images
- **File Size**: Keeps app bundle size smaller
- **Quality**: High-quality professional product images
- **Flexibility**: Easy to change images without rebuilding the app

**Trade-offs**:
- Requires internet connection for images
- Potential loading delays
- Need for error handling when images fail to load

## üé® UI/UX Decisions

### 1. Design System: Material Design

**Decision**: Used Material Design with custom green theme

**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Familiar patterns for users
- **Accessibility**: Built-in accessibility features
- **Cross-platform**: Consistent look across platforms
- **Development Speed**: Pre-built components reduce development time

**Customizations**:
- Green color scheme to match grocery/fresh food theme
- Custom card designs for products
- Rounded corners for modern look

### 2. Navigation: Simple Stack Navigation

**Decision**: Used Flutter's built-in Navigator with push/pop

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Straightforward navigation for the app's structure
- **Performance**: Efficient for the app's navigation needs
- **User Experience**: Standard mobile navigation patterns

**Alternative Considered**: Named routes or go_router
- Would be better for complex navigation with deep linking
- More setup overhead for this simple app

### 3. Product Grid Layout

**Decision**: 2-column grid with 0.75 aspect ratio

**Rationale**:
- **Mobile Optimization**: Good balance of content visibility and usability
- **Touch Targets**: Adequate size for finger interaction
- **Information Density**: Shows enough products without overwhelming

## üîß Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Challenge: Cart Persistence

**Problem**: Need to persist cart data between app sessions

**Solution**: 
- Implemented CartService with SharedPreferences
- JSON serialization for complex cart data
- Automatic loading on app start

**Code Example**:
```dart
Future<void> saveCart(List<CartItem> cartItems) async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  final cartJson = cartItems.map((item) => item.toJson()).toList();
  await prefs.setString('cart_items', json.encode(cartJson));
}
```

### 2. Challenge: State Management Across Screens

**Problem**: Need to share cart and product state across multiple screens

**Solution**:
- Used Provider with ChangeNotifier
- MultiProvider at app root for global state access
- Consumer widgets for reactive UI updates

**Code Example**:
```dart
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => CartProvider()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => ProductProvider()),
  ],
  child: MaterialApp(...)
)
```

### 3. Challenge: Product Search and Filtering

**Problem**: Need real-time search and category filtering

**Solution**:
- Implemented filtering logic in ProductProvider
- Combined search and category filters
- Debounced search for better performance

**Code Example**:
```dart
void _applyFilters() {
  List<Product> filtered = _products;
  
  if (_selectedCategory != 'All') {
    filtered = filtered.where((product) => 
      product.category == _selectedCategory).toList();
  }
  
  if (_searchQuery.isNotEmpty) {
    filtered = filtered.where((product) => 
      product.name.toLowerCase().contains(_searchQuery.toLowerCase())).toList();
  }
  
  _filteredProducts = filtered;
}
```

### 4. Challenge: Responsive Design

**Problem**: App needs to work on different screen sizes

**Solution**:
- Used flexible layouts with GridView
- Responsive padding and spacing
- Scalable text and images

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Approach

**Focus Areas**:
1. **Core Functionality**: Add/remove from cart, persistence
2. **UI Responsiveness**: Different screen sizes and orientations
3. **Navigation**: Smooth transitions between screens
4. **Error Handling**: Network image failures, empty states

**Testing Platforms**:
- Web (Chrome) - Primary testing platform
- Android (emulator) - Secondary testing
- iOS (simulator) - Cross-platform verification

### Automated Testing Considerations

**Current State**: Manual testing only

**Future Improvements**:
- Unit tests for business logic (CartService, ProductService)
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for user flows

## üìä Performance Considerations

### 1. Image Loading

- Efficient filtering algorithms
- Lazy loading of product data

### 3. Memory Management
